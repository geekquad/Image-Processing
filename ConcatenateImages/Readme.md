## Concatenating images vertically and horizontally using OpenCV.
* We have used inbuilt function of Opencv like `vconcat` and `hconcat` for implementing vertical and horizontal concatenation. 
* Code is present in `Concatenate Images.ipynb`. 
* You can simply download and execute it in jupyter notebook.
* Some sample images are also added in folder named `images`.
