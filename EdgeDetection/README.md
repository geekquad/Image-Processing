# Edge Detection
Implementation of the following Edge Detection methods:
* Canny Edge Detection
* Robert Edge Detection
* Prewitt Edge Detection
<br>
    Prewitt operator is used for Prewitt edge detection in an image. It detects two types of edges: Horizontal and 
    Vertical. Edges are calculated by using difference between corresponding pixel intensities of an image. 
    All the masks that are used for edge detection are also known as derivative masks. Because as we have stated 
    many times before in this series of tutorials that image is also a signal so changes in a signal can only be 
    calculated using differentiation. So thatâ€™s why these operators are also called as derivative operators or 
    derivative masks.
* Sobel Edge Detection
