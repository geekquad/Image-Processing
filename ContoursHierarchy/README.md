# CONTOURS HIERARCHY in OPENCV

## What is heirarchy?
- In case of nested figures, we call outer one as parent and inner one as child. 
- This way, contours in an image has some relationship to each other. And we can specify how one contour is connected to each other, like, is it child of some other contour, or is it a parent etc.
- Representation of this relationship is called the Hierarchy.

## Hierarchy Representation in OpenCV
OpenCV represents it as an array of four values : <h3><b>[Next, Previous, First_Child, Parent]</b></h3>

# Contour Retrieval Mode

## 1. RETR_LIST
- It simply retrieves all the contours, but doesn't create any parent-child relationship. 
- Parents and kids are equal under this rule, and they are just contours. ie they all belongs to same hierarchy level.
- So here, 3rd and 4th term in hierarchy array is always -1. 

### Contours Hierarchy is:
```sh 
    array([[[ 1, -1, -1, -1],
            [ 2,  0, -1, -1],
            [ 3,  1, -1, -1],
            [ 4,  2, -1, -1],
            [ 5,  3, -1, -1],
            [ 6,  4, -1, -1],
            [ 7,  5, -1, -1],
            [-1,  6, -1, -1]]], dtype=int32)
```

## 2. RETR_EXTERNAL
- It returns only extreme outer flags. 
- All child contours are left behind.

### Contours Hierarchy is:
```sh 
    array([[[ 1, -1, -1, -1],
            [ 2,  0, -1, -1],
            [-1,  1, -1, -1]]], dtype=int32)
```

## 3. RETR_CCOMP
- This flag retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level hierarchy. ie external contours of the object (ie its boundary) are placed in hierarchy-1.
- The contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in hierarchy-2. 
- If any object inside it, its contour is placed again in hierarchy-1 only. And its hole in hierarchy-2 and so on.

### Contours Hierarchy is:
```sh 
    array([[[ 1, -1, -1, -1],
            [ 2,  0, -1, -1],
            [ 4,  1,  3, -1],
            [-1, -1, -1,  2],
            [ 6,  2,  5, -1],
            [-1, -1, -1,  4],
            [ 7,  4, -1, -1],
            [-1,  6, -1, -1]]], dtype=int32)
```

## 4. RETR_TREE
- It retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy list. 

### Contours Hierarchy is:
```sh 
    array([[[ 6, -1,  1, -1],
            [-1, -1,  2,  0],
            [-1, -1,  3,  1],
            [-1, -1,  4,  2],
            [ 5, -1, -1,  3],
            [-1,  4, -1,  3],
            [ 7,  0, -1, -1],
            [-1,  6, -1, -1]]], dtype=int32)
```
