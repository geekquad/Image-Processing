# Perspective Transformation
* We implemented a `transformation function` which takes `image` and `4 point` as input and outputs the `warped image`.
* Code is present in `Perspective_Transformation.ipynb`.
* You can simply download and execute it in jupyter notebook.
* A sample test image is provided.
