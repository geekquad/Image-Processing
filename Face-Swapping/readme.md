### Steps used for this project
- Taking two images â€“ one as the source and another as a destination.
- Using the dlib landmark detector on both these images.
- Joining the dots in the landmark detector to form triangles.
- Extracting these triangles.
- Placing the source image on the destination and smoothening the face.
